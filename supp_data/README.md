---

This dataset contains what is needed to reproduce the application of the ANM model on the Coerebinae dataset.

## Description of the Data and file structure

You can find the trait dataset in a .csv format and a tree file in .tre format as well as the script to run the analyses (Analysis_thraupidae.R) and the script with the ABM model (mcmc_ADIM.R).

## Sharing/access Information

The data was derived from: Reaney, A. M., Y. Bouchenak-Khelladi, J. A. Tobias, and A. Abzhanov. 2020. Ecological and morphological determinants of evolutionary diversification in Darwin’s finches and their relatives. Ecology and Evolution 10:14020–14032.

The scripts are original.
